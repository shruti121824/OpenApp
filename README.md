# OpenApp  - Alpha

The Goal is to Create a base framework for creating web applcations. 

It will be composed of a number of other open source prjects :

1. Asp.Net Boilerplate 3 [https://aspnetboilerplate.com/]
* Layered Architecture
* Modular Design
* Domain Driven Design
* Well Documented
* Multi Tenancy
* User and role management

2. CoreUI [http://coreui.io/]
* Bootstrap 4 Admin Template

3. Vuejs 2 [https://vuejs.org/]
* Progressive JavaScript Framework
* Approachable
* Versatile
* Performant

4. Element UI library [http://element.eleme.io]
* Vuejs 2 based component library

We started from Asp.Net Boilerplate 3 and chose for dotnetcore, entity framework core, sql server, mvc.

We replaced the BSB Admin with the CoreUI Admin Template.

We rewrite the UI of User management, Role Management and Tenant Management with generic autogenerated ui based on the Application service layer of Asp.net Boilerplate enhanced with some annotations on the Dtos.

This autogenerated UI framework included in OpenApp is made with vuejs and use the javascript proxies generated by Abp + Json schemas generated for the Application services and Dtos. This UI framework let you also rapidelly create custom crud UI for your entities.

Based on the Asp.net Boilerplate standard template, we create standard reusable modules for most of web applications including user, role and tenant managment that are available as nuget packages. We created also a Mvc Starter Project and a Spa Starter Project to quickly start a new application develoment.

This way the reusable part of the Abp template are isolated and maintained centrally in this OpenApp Project.

## How to start
* Checkout development branch
* Open Satrabel.OpenApp.sln Solution in root folder
* Create a database named OpenAppDb in your Sql Server
* Check (and modify if necessary) the default connectionstring in \Satrabel.Starter.Web.Spa\appsettings.json 
* Run the solution using Ctrl+F5 with Satrabel.Starter.Web.Spa as startup project 
* The browser will open asking you to refresh the page. Refresh the page.
*    Instead, if the browser just closes, then run the project again. (It means you were hitting F5 instead of Ctrl+F5. No worries.)
* Login with User name 'admin' and password '123qwe'
* Goto Roles. Give Admin all the available permissions
